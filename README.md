# chatbot-using-nltk
Developed a simple AI chatbot using Python, NLTK, and TF-IDF. It applies NLP techniques like tokenization and lemmatization to process user input, detects greetings, and retrieves context-aware answers from a text corpus. Added a Q/A mapping mechanism to ensure accurate responses instead of repeating user queries.
